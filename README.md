## Notes
- Remap Brightness keys to Fn+PrtScr & Fn+Pause Break. And Volume keys to Fn+F11 (NumLock) & Fn+F12 (ScrLock). And i am also disable Fn+Arrow key, you can see SSDT-PS2K to change this if you donâ€™t like my mapping.
- Mine have disabled CFG Lock, so Kernel patch for CfgLock in config.plist have been disabled. Enable Kernel patch for CfgLock if yours not disabled yet. I had write the guide in my blog (Bahasa Indonesia) [Disable CFG Lock pada Acer E5-476G](https://akhmad.id/blog/disable-cfg-lock-pada-acer-e5-476g/).
